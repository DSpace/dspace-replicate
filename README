DSpace Replication Task Suite
=============================

The Replication Task Suite is an add-on for DSpace which allows you to more easily
replicate / backup DSpace content to another location. It utilizes the DSpace
Curation System to allow all backup/restore/auditing tasks to be performed
either via Command Line (CLI) or from the DSpace Admin User Interface.

Replication / Backup Locations
-------------------------------
Supported Replication / Backup locations include:
  * Local filesystem folder
  * Mounted drive
  * DuraCloud (http://www.duracloud.org)

Backup Format
-------------
DSpace content is replicated / backed up as a set of AIPs (Archival Information Packages).
The Replication Task Suite supports two different AIP formats:
  1. The DSpace AIP Format based on METS (Default)
     https://wiki.lyrasis.org/display/DSDOC8x/DSpace+AIP+Format
  2. A BagIt based AIP Format (Beta)

Sample Supported Actions
------------------------
The Replication Task Suite allows you to backup DSpace content, restore/replace DSpace
content (from a backup), or audit your existing backup. Some sample actions included:
  * Replicate / Back up either on demand (via Admin UI or CLI) or on a scheduled basis (using a cron job)
  * Restore / Replace content in DSpace based on current backups (via Admin UI or CLI)
  * Perform checksum audit of your replicated content (via Admin UI or CLI)
  * Provide a rough estimate of the amount of storage space your AIPs will require (via Admin UI or CLI)
  * Keep a running "odometer" of all Input / Output transfers (via Admin UI or CLI)
